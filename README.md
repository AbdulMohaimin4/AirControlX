# AirControlX
## A Project Based on OS Concepts

This project simulates a complete flight management system with air traffic control, departures, and arrivals across various flight types and runways utilizing Posix APIs in C++.

Several key concepts, upon which the OS architecture is built, are put to work here. Namely mutex locks, semaphores, multithreading, multiprocessing, synchronization, scheduling, and process coordination.
